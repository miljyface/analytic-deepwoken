## Interpretations
![what you'd see when you analyse stats](assets/evo_plot.webp)

This graph is separated into three segments, **Attunement**, **Weapon**, and **Base**. Each segment contains non-zero stat categories, with three stems to each category, the magnitude of the stems denoting the investment. 

- **Red**: Pre-Shrine
- **Gray**: Immediately after Shrine of Order
- **Black**: Post-Shrine

For stats that are not required reinvestments (Fortitude, Weapons, Attunements), a blue bar will be drawn between the **Gray** apex and the **Black** apex, denoting the **Reinvestment Interval**. For key stats, this interval will be gray instead.

The total blue on the graph is the amount of points that you have returned after using Shrine of Order. Builds with more blue usually means an unoptimal build, but this is not concrete.

![what you'd see when you do ehp](assets/kit_breakdown.webp)

This graph breaks down your build health to its components and scales them with the following flags:

- **RA Effectiveness (0-30)**
- **TTF Effectiveness (0-10)**
- **CCharm Effectiveness (0-~12.5)**
- **Permanent Reinforce (True/False)**

The EHP testing scenarios are as follows:

- **100 Enemy DPS**
- **50% Enemy PEN**
- Phys Kit: **112HP, 33% Phys from pips**
- HP Kit: **154HP, 4% Phys from pips** 

For transparency, this is the assumed kit for the ehp calculation.

Phys:
- **Parasol Planter: 9hp 12%phys (1 rare hp, 4 rare phys, 1 leg phys)**
- **Bastions of Enmity: 17hp 18%phys (1 rare hp, 1 rare phys, 4 leg phys)**
- **Confessor's Charm: 13hp 3%phys (1 rare eth, 2 rare hp, 1 leg hp)**

HP:
- **Parasol Planter: 26hp 2%phys (1 rare phys, 4 rare hp, 1 leg hp)**
- **Bastions of Enmity: 37hp 2%phys (1 rare phys, 1 rare hp, 4 leg hp)**
- **Fauld of Enmity: 18hp 0%phys (1 rare eth, 2 rare hp, 2 leg hp)**

Constant:

- Star Boots: 30hp
- Moonlit Earrings: 2hp
- Citadel Frames: 5hp
- 4x Moon/Waning: 36hp

## Examples

- **Lookup Mantra (proper)**:  `.weapon Champion's Sword`
- **Lookup Weapon (substring search)**:  `.weapon n's swor`
- **Lookup Weapon (spellcheck)**: `.weapon gale hb`
- **Analyze Build EHP**: `(replying to build link) ehp`
